# UAH Exchanger

App for convert currencies developed using Javascript library React and Typescript as typed superset javascript. For state contor i used Redux and Axios as API wrapper for it. Also i used Redux middlewares: thunk for use async code and middleware for use strings in dispatch.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

```
npm i
```
or
```
yarn
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development with fake API ([JSON-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server))
```
npm start
```
or
```
yarn start
```

### Run json-server by another terminal
```
npm run server
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development with production API
```
npm run dev
```
or
```
yarn dev
```

### Run your tests

```
npm test
```
or
```
yarn test
```
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```
or
```
yarn build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

```
npm run eject
```
or
```
yarn eject
```

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
